        <p tabindex="0">My name is David Yates Spearman and I am a father, an aspiring web developer, an artist and someone who is not a huge fan of writing biographies. I have a three year old son named Finn and a wonderful soon-to-be wife named Kat. I attended the Winthrop University Honor’s college for three years and graduated with a degree in Philosophy and Religious Studies. Almost immediately after graduating from Winthrop I started at Red Ventures and have been here for the last two years. During my time at Red Ventures I started on Verizon Fios, moved to Verizon Wireless for a time, and I made a very brief pit-stop at Direct TV before returning to Fios. The most exciting point in my career at RV has certainly been the start of the ITA program and am thrilled with the prospects that the completion of this program will bring and am overly eager to see where it will take me.</p>

    <div class="col">
        <p tabindex="0">One of  my more interesting hobbies is that I like to create propane flame effects or ‘poofers’, such as the one in the image below. A poofer is a flame-thrower type effect composed of a fuel-source, a capacitor, a pilot, and a lever to release the gas. Propane is the fuel-source in this case and the capacitor is a tank that stores the fuel before it is released. The piping on the poofer is a very high rated material, such as the ones that would deliver gas through an industrial building. The lever releases the fuel out into the pilot which causes a large (and safe) cloud of flames to be dispersed into the air. A poofer can be mobile or stationary. In the case of this image my poofer is a mobile poofer fashioned as a walking staff. However a stationary effect does allow for a larger capacitor and creates a larger flame or ‘poof’. Poofers can be fashioned in a variety of shapes and sizes depending on the available piping materials.</p>

    <div class="col final">
        <p tabindex="0">I originally learned about and then how to safely create poofers through my involvement in the Burning Man community. A burn is an interactive artists event that operates based on the Ten Principles which are Radical Inclusion, Gifting, Decommodification, Radical Self-Reliance, Radical Self-expression, Communal Effort, Civic Responsibility, Leaving No Trace, Participation, and Immediacy. Through these events I have learned a lot about leadership, serving in a volunteer position as a coordinator for running the art department at a local Georgia burn. Through these events I have been introduced to a community of brilliant engineers, artists, and community organizers that have spawned my love of innovation and technology and unlocking their potential for a collaborative good.</p>
